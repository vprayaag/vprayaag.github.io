I am a fourth-year graduate student in the [theory of computation group](https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, advised by [Boaz Barak](https://www.boazbarak.org/).

I am interested in the phenomenon of information-computation gaps in average-case problems. Recently, I have been investigating this phenomenon in the context of discrepancy theory, random CSPs, estimating parameters of high-dimensional, heavy-tailed distributions, the graph matching problem and differential privacy. Please do reach out if you would like to discuss these or related topics!


My graduate studies are supported by an [NSF Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
