I am a fifth-year graduate student in the [theory of computation group](https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, advised by [Boaz Barak](https://www.boazbarak.org/). **I am currently on the job market**.

My research focuses on the computational complexity of statistical inference, lying at the intersection of theoretical computer science, statistics, probability and data science. Recently, I have been investigating the phenomenon of information-computation gaps in the context of discrepancy theory, random CSPs, estimating parameters of high-dimensional, heavy-tailed distributions, and differential privacy. 

My graduate studies are supported by an [NSF Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
